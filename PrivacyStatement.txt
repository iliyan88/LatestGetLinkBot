Privacy Statement
We develop GetLinked, the Bot to send you the best venue recommendations directly to your Facebook Messenger, Skype or Telegram chat.

We know that you care about how your data is used, and we take your privacy very seriously. By using GetLinked, you are accepting the practices outlined in this policy.

We don’t store any user specific data except the public username. This is the only information we keep.

Please contact us under office@perspecta-soft.com to report abuse & requests to access or delete personal information.

Skype

Our servers also collect log information used to identify bugs in our code. The information includes data sent to and from Microsoft Skype. The old data is automatically deleted once log is full.

Since we don’t know your email, we communicate with you only thru your Skype account. But we don’t initiate discussion ourselves – we always wait for you to start. We do not sell your information to anyone. We don’t encrypt the data stored on our servers, but still it is safe.

GetLinked is enabled by Microsoft Bot Framework. The Microsoft Bot Framework is a set of web-services that enable intelligent services and connections using conversation channels you authorize. As a service provider, Microsoft will transmit content you provide to our bot in order to enable the service. For more information about Microsoft privacy policies please see their privacy statement here. In addition, your interactions with this bot are also subject to the conversational channel’s applicable terms of use, privacy and data collection policies. To report abuse when using a bot that uses the Microsoft Bot Framework to Microsoft, please visit the Microsoft Bot Framework website at botframework.com and use the “Report Abuse” link in the menu to contact Microsoft.

Privacy policy may change. Using GetLinked is subject to Terms and Privacy policy.

This Privacy Policy is effective as of 06/07/2018
